# nextflow-stack

An AWS stack for running Nextflow pipelines on Batch using shared resources.

ðŸš§

Highlight key aspects

* Precise resource allocation requests under SPOT pricing model
* No EBS costs and local SSD discounted via SPOT pricing
* No duplication of Batch queues
* Fusion, Wave
* Improved resume experience compared to use of ephermal workdir disk
* Ability to highly optimise instances for individual processes

Future work

* Dynamic queue selection
* Retry on SPOT pre-emption X times
* BYO bucket
* CodePipeline for deployment

UMCCR-specific branch ([link](https://github.com/scwatts/oncoanalyser/tree/umccr))

> set to be separated into a different repo under a different name

#### Design

ðŸš§

Diagram (avoid overlap with Overview diagram) including reference data etc

Section detailing current compromises

* GDS token access
* Migrating data from GDS to S3 for execution
* Manual Docker image build process
* Not fully optimised for speed; show timeline or similar
* Many Docker images on DockerHub, ideally would be on ECR
* Only broad control over processes run currently

#### Usage

ðŸš§

Diagram describing common run modes with correponding commands

* WGTS
* WGS only
* WTS only
* WGTS with existing WGS
* WGTS with existing WTS

> include run resuming and use of this as an alternative to providing existing data

> note how to run any individual process/stage with the appropriate inputs

#### Notes

ðŸš§

Other important items to note

* Fusion usually gives much better performance but not always
