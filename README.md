# nextflow-stack

An AWS stack for running Nextflow pipelines on Batch using shared resources.

ðŸš§

Highlight key aspects

* Precise resource allocation requests under SPOT pricing model
* No EBS costs and local SSD discounted via SPOT pricing
* No duplication of Batch queues
* Fusion, Wave
* Improved resume experience compared to use of ephermal workdir disk
* Ability to highly optimise instances for individual processes

Future work

* Dynamic queue selection
* Retry on SPOT pre-emption X times
* BYO bucket
* CodePipeline for deployment

#### Design

ðŸš§

Diagram (avoid overlap with Overview diagram) including reference data etc

Section detailing current compromises

* GDS token access
* Migrating data from GDS to S3 for execution
* Manual Docker image build process
* Not fully optimised for speed; show timeline or similar
* Many Docker images on DockerHub, ideally would be on ECR
* Only broad control over processes run currently
* Passing run configuration by CLI args is somewhat clumbsy
  * Alternative: JSON on remote (S3, API call); could be extended to general config

Items that need to be addressed

* STAR currently does **not** accept multiple forward/reverse FASTQs [*unlikely to be needed*]
* Extra arguments for `run.sh` are ignored, error should be raised
* Job cancellation is difficult when the pipeline crashes
* I have observed a rare issue with unexpected Fusion shutdown that interrupts processing
* No resource tagging; TBD in CDK stack and have instances self-assign `Name` appropriately
* Staging data from GDS to S3 suffers significant slow down after ~one hour (bursting related?)

#### Usage

ðŸš§

Diagram describing common run modes with correponding commands

* WGTS
* WGS only
* WTS only
* WGTS with existing WGS
* WGTS with existing WTS

> include run resuming and use of this as an alternative to providing existing data

> note how to run any individual process/stage with the appropriate inputs

#### Notes

ðŸš§

Other important items to note

* Fusion usually gives much better performance but not always
