  // NOTE(SW): AWS Batch jobs can only run where there is allocatable memory present on the instances, and this amount
  // is never the total capacity since ECS reserves memory and the system also occpies several hundred MiB. See
  // https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/memory-management.html
  // NOTE(SW): Anything less than a 2.GB buffer appears to prevent Batch jobs from running on target instances
